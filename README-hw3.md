If this link does not work, the screen shot is in my assets folder.

I got the password to generate but it's giving me 4 extra charaters than i ask it to do. I'm not really sure why that is, but I am continuing to work on it. I feel like it's looping through one or more of the criteria twice.

I'm not sure why but when I click on this link from github I am getting an error, but when click go live from the html code everything works perfect. It's pretty frustrating but I have no idea why I'm getting the illegal return error.
